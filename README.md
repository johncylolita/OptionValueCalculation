# Option Value Calculation
This code is the initial work on the learnings of python coding with django framework using the knowledge of financial mathematics topics. In this code, I have used Black-Scholes formula to find the Call and Put Option Value of a stock with the data given such as the Spot price, Strike price, rate of interest, volatility and time to expiry.
